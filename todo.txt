TODO:

- 'blc --init' does not compile there is missing '#import "std/print".
- Documentation generated struct types miss base type.
  - Add also link to source file on github.

- Use #run to mark function to be executed in compile time on the call side: '#run foo()'.
- Use #run to mark function executed only in compile time on the declaration side: 'foo :: fn () #run {}'.
- Consider #import and #load to be limited only to the file scope.
- Polymorp types cannot be easily identified; i.e. 'table_insert' should be something like
  this 'table_insert :: fn (tbl: *Table)' where 'Table' can be any polymorph type. However this is a
  bit problematic due to the way how polymorph types are generated by compile-time funcitons...
- Static if in other than local scopes.
- No scopes introduced by static ifs? But what about {}? Maybe C style is better?
- Allow creation of scoped constants in structure bodies:

    foo :: struct {
        THIS_IS_CONSTANT :: 10;

        number: s32;
    }

- !array => array.len == 0
- Introduce calling conventions.
- Change syntax of default argument value assignment to ':'.
- loop - else ?

	loop i := 0; i < arr.len; i += 1 {
		...
	} else {}

- Anonymous structs/unions?

TODO BIG STUFF:

- Implement custom multithreaded linker for windows, lld is slow same as link.exe.
- Factor-out mir generation into separate pass executed per unit. This might be the fisrt step to
  support proper conditional #load and #import.
- Allow code generation from build script pipelines probably using compiler hooks.
- Implement code browsing from build script to allow custom usage checks.

DONE:
